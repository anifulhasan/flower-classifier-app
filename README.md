# flower-classifier-app
A deep learning-based flower classifier web app built using TensorFlow, Keras, and Streamlit. Users can upload images, and the app predicts the flower type using a fine-tuned MobileNetV2 model. I implemented image preprocessing, model integration, and deployed it via Streamlit Cloud.
